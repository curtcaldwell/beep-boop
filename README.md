## Behavior Driven Development model, and specs:
_Returns a range of numbers from 0 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:


|Example Input  | Example Output                                 |
|-------------- |-----------------                               |
|0              |["Beep"]                                        |
|1              |["Boop"]                                        |
|/3             |["I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."]|

* These exceptions are written from least to most important.
* The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third.
* So, for example, in your finished program the number 10 should be replaced with "Boop!", and the number 30 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
* A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
